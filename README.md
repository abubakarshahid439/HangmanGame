# HangmanGame
This Hangman game allows users to register or log in, choose a word at random from a file, and attempt to guess it letter by letter. Players have six chances to guess the word correctly, with each incorrect guess drawing part of the hangman figure. The game tracks wins, losses, and scores, and stores user game records in a file.
